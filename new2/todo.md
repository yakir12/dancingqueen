# First
Figure out what image dimensions, and fps are best
Benchmark fps and memory and speeds
Stress test it
Test and see what is the best way to crop that image into a w x w square
Get an IR strobe and place it well
Match all of this to the size of the arena and the size of the apriltag
Orient the camera to match north
Fasten the camera in a more permanent way
Mark the location of the arena and the posts to center it all
Calculate the window size in the detector to match the apriltag on the arena
Clean the code base

# Second
Measure the calibration parameters needed for approximate transformation from pixel to real-world coordinates: ring center in image, ring zero azimuth relative to image axes, cm per pixel. 
Record: ring radius in cm, magnetic North direction, room layout, ...?
Make sure you can reproduce the original data from the saved/logged data

# Third
Blacken out the LEDs of the arduno and rpi
Get a box with a fan for the rpi
Close the tent, fix it up, etc
Add instructions

# Last
Test it all
