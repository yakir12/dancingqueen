figure out what image dimensions, and fps are best
test and see what is the best way to crop that image into a w x w square
match all of this to the size of the arena and the size of the apriltag
calculate the window size in the detector to match the apriltag on the arena
mark the location of the arena and the posts to center it all
fasten the camera in a more permanent way
orient the camera to match north
calculate the calibration parameters needed
blacken out the LEDs of the arduno and rpi
get a box with a fan for the rpi
get an IR strobe and place it well
close the tent, fix it up, etc
test it all
benchmark fps and memory and speeds
clean the code base
add instructions
